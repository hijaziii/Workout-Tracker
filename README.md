# Workout Tracker

* I have generated a workout tracker. where users can track daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Users are able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. Users have the option when they load the page to create a new workout, or continue with thier last workout.
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.
